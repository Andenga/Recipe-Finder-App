Building a recipe finder using an API involves several key steps. You'll need to choose an appropriate recipe API, set up a project environment, write code to interact with the API, and create a user interface for the application. Below are step-by-step instructions:

### 1. Choose a Recipe API
- Research and select a recipe API that suits your needs. Popular options include Spoonacular, Edamam, and TheMealDB.
- Register for an API key if required by the service.
- Familiarize yourself with the API documentation to understand how to make requests and handle responses.

### 2. Set Up Your Project Environment
- Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) if they are not already installed on your system.
- Create a new directory for your project.
- Initialize a new Node.js project by running `npm init` in your project directory.
- Install necessary packages like `express` for setting up a server and `axios` or `fetch` for making HTTP requests.
  ```bash
  npm install express axios
  ```

### 3. Write the Backend Code
- Create a server using Express.js.
  ```javascript
  const express = require('express');
  const app = express();
  const port = 3000;

  app.listen(port, () => console.log(`Server running on port ${port}`));
  ```
- Add routes to handle recipe search requests.
- Use `axios` or `fetch` to make API requests to the recipe API using the endpoint provided in the API documentation.
- Process the API response and send the relevant data back to the client.

### 4. Create the Frontend
- Create HTML and CSS files for your user interface.
- Your HTML file should include a search bar and a section to display search results.
- Use JavaScript to add functionality to the search bar. When a user submits a query, use `fetch` or `axios` to send a request to your backend.
- Handle the response from your backend and display the recipe results on the page.

### 5. Testing
- Test your application thoroughly to ensure that it can handle various search queries and display results correctly.
- Check for any errors in console and debug as needed.

### 6. Deployment
- Once everything is working correctly, you can deploy your application. Platforms like Heroku, Netlify, or Vercel offer easy deployment solutions for full-stack applications.

### 7. Additional Features (Optional)
- Implement features like pagination, advanced search filters (by cuisine, diet, etc.), and saving favorite recipes.
- Enhance the UI/UX with more advanced CSS or JavaScript frameworks like React or Vue.js.

### Example Code for a Simple API Request
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const axios = require('axios');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.get('/search', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const query = req.query.q; // Get search query from URL parameters
    const apiUrl = `https://api.example.com/recipes/search?apiKey=YOUR_API_KEY&query=${query}`;
    const response = await axios.get(apiUrl);
    res.json(response.data);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).send('Error occurred');
  }
});

app.listen(port, () => console.log(`Server running on port ${port}`));
```

### Notes
- Replace `https://api.example.com/recipes/search` with the actual endpoint of the API you choose.
- Ensure you handle API keys securely and do not expose them in client-side code.
- You may need to handle CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) depending on your setup.
- Make sure to follow the API's terms of use, especially regarding request limits and attribution.
